# Docker Learning Progress - 2025-05-12

Today, I continued learning about Docker and applied some key concepts.

## What I Learned:
------------
### 1. Docker Basics
- Learned the fundamentals of **Docker** including containers, images, and Dockerfile basics.
- Understood the role of **Docker** in ensuring consistency across different environments.

### 2. Dockerfile Instructions
- Experimented with basic **Dockerfile** commands such as `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, and `CMD`.
- Created a simple Dockerfile to set up a Python environment.

### 3. Docker Compose
- Learned about **Docker Compose** and how it is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a YAML configuration file.
- Wrote a sample `docker-compose.yml` file for a web app with an NGINX container.

### 4. Docker Networking
- Explored different Docker networking modes like `bridge`, `host`, and `none`.

### 5. Docker Volumes
- Learned how to use **volumes** to persist data across container restarts, which is crucial for handling persistent data in applications.

### 6. Docker Registry
- Discovered how to interact with Docker registries, including pushing and pulling images to/from Docker Hub.

## Next Steps:
- Continue exploring Docker Swarm and Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- Start integrating Docker with a Rust-based backend and React frontend project.

This document helps me keep track of my progress and updates in learning Docker. I plan to continue adding updates as I learn more.
